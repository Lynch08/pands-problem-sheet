# BMI.py calculates a persons Body Mass Index using the inputs of height in cm and weight in Kg
Assign weight and heights as floating points - this is becase even if you enter the weight and height as integers there is a good chance they will become decimals after the calculation

Calculate the BMI using weight/height (meters squared)

Round to two decimal places so output will be clean

Display BMI using print function
